# ANN Classification - Churn Prediction Project
This project leverages an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for customer churn prediction. The model is trained using Keras and TensorFlow, ensuring accurate classification of customers likely to churn. The project includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment through a Streamlit web application.

### Installation Guide
To set up the project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ANN-Project.git
cd ANN-Project

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or later). Then, install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 3: Train & Evaluate the Model
Run the experiment.ipynb notebook to train and evaluate the ANN model.

The model will be saved in .h5 format inside the models/ directory.
Encoders and scalers for categorical variables and feature scaling will be stored as .pkl files in the encoders_scalers/ directory.

Alternatively, you can execute the training script programmatically:
python experiment.py

### Step 4: Make Predictions
Execute prediction.ipynb to load the trained model and make predictions.

### Step 5: Run the Churn Prediction App
Once the model is trained, deploy the application using Streamlit:
streamlit run app.py

Your interactive Churn Prediction App is now ready to use!
